# MLND_P0-Exploring-Titanic-Survival-Data
An attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic tragedy. 
This was the first project from Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree.

## Project Overview
-----------------------
In this optional project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. We will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce us to some of the concepts of Machine Learning.

## Software & Libraries
------------------------
This project uses the following Softwares and Python Libraries :
- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- iPython Notebook
